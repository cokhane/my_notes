############################################# Nameservers

- its the phone book of the internet

when you see something like xxx.com your browser doenst actually understand andyou.ph its need ip


### Where nameservers fit in DNS chain 

DNS ( domaain name systen ) the system that translate names like xxx.com to and IP address

1. you type xxx.com2
2. browser ask you ISP. who knows where xxx.com lives?
3. ISP checks the root DNS server. they point to .phone
4. ph server says "ask these name server. ns1.cloudflare.com, ns2.cloudfare2.com" 
5. those name servers finally says HERE is the IP

then browser connect to it

so name servers are the authorative source for your domain DNS records


### GoDaddy vs cloudflare

- both can act as a DNS provider but they do it at different layers 

###GoDaddy

- is your domain registrar ( where you buy your domain )
- by default, when you register a domain, go daddy gives you their own nameservers, like NS01, domaincontrol.com

You can store DNS records (a,cname,mx,txt,etc) inside goDaddys DNS panel

so if you keep GoDaddys nameserver, you manege your DNS from goDaddys


###Cloudflare

- can also act as your DNS Host (and much more - CDN, security, caching etc)
- when you add your domain to Cloudflare, Cloudflare will give you new nameserver 

ada.ns.cloudflare.com 
jack.ns.cloudflare.com

to make cloudflare take control. you must go back to go Daddy, and change your nameserver to cloudflare ones 
once you do that go daddy will stop controlling your DNS so now cloudflare nameserver at the authority



###Why you want to transfer to go daddy to cloudflare
