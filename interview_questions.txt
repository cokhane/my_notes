############################################################################################### ANSWER BELOW


###1.

#Memory optimization
- use generators and iterators instead of loading all data into memory at once 
- implement lazy evaluation- only computer what you need when you need it 
- memory mapping allows you to access file contents without loading everything on RAM

Leverage NumPy/pandas vectorization - these libraries use optimized C implementations that can be 10-100x faster than pure Python loops for numerical operations.

- for cpu bound use multiprocess
- for i/o you async or multithread
- better concurent code writing technique like divide them in chunks

- improve algorithm
- use cache systems like redis
- early termination, when task is achieve break out loops

###2. 

Service layer pattern - separate business logic from views:
Dependency injection - use factories and dependency containers to make components testable and loosely coupled.
Repository pattern for data access abstraction, making it easier to test and switch data sources.

#Auth
JWT with refresh tokens for stateless authentication:
Role-based access control (RBAC) with decorators:

#request
Input validation like marshmallow 
Rate limiting to prevent abuse:

#Security Measures
CORS configuration:
SQL injection prevention using parameterized queries and ORM query builders.
XSS protection by sanitizing user input and using Content Security Policy headers:

#Scalability
Asynchronous task processing using Celery for heavy operations.


###3.

- i would use asnycronous programming

Primary Libraries:

asyncio: Built-in Python async framework
aiohttp: Async HTTP client/server library
httpx: Modern alternative to requests with async support

Supporting Libraries:

tenacity: Retry logic with exponential backoff
prometheus-client: Metrics and monitoring
fastapi: Async web framework for APIs

Performance: Parallel execution reduces total response time
Scalability: Non-blocking I/O allows handling more concurrent requests
Resilience: Circuit breakers and retries handle service failures gracefully
Resource Efficiency: Async I/O uses fewer threads than synchronous approaches


5.
Move heavy computations to separate worker processes that run independently from the main application.
i would use celery for this task with redis


7.

I'd use Python's built-in asyncio library, leveraging the async and await keywords to handle many concurrent I/O-bound tasks. This approach allows the application to perform other work while waiting for slow operations like network requests or database queries to complete, rather than blocking and wasting CPU cycles.



12.
- Consistent Naming Conventions 命名
- Proper Use of HTTP Verbs ✅
-  Standardized Data Format and Structure 📜
- Clear and Consistent Error Handling 
- API Versioning
- Enable Filtering, Sorting, and Pagination 
- Documentation as a Deliverable
- testing



############################################################################################### ANSWER PART 2 

1) Optimizing a Python function that processes millions of records

Mindset: measure → reduce allocations → stream data → use native/compiled ops → parallelize where it’s safe.

Checklist (in priority order):

Profile first: cProfile, snakeviz, line_profiler, memory_profiler to find your hottest 1–2 functions and largest allocators.

Avoid loading everything in memory:

Stream from disk/network with iterators/generators.

Chunk large files (e.g., read CSV in 1–10M row chunks).

Use yield pipelines and itertools to keep memory flat.

Prefer vectorized/compiled code:

Use NumPy/polars/pyarrow for numeric/columnar ops.

For custom tight loops, consider Cython / numba @njit.

Minimize Python overhead:

Use local variable lookups, avoid attribute churn inside loops.

Pre-bind functions (local_append = out.append), avoid lambda in hot loops.

Reuse buffers (bytearray, memoryview) instead of recreating.

Data structures: choose arrays over lists for numeric data; use dict/set for O(1) membership; consider dataclasses with slots=True or __slots__ to cut memory.

I/O & serialization:

Prefer msgpack or orjson over JSON for speed.

Use gzip/zstd streams to reduce I/O volume if CPU is spare.

Parallelization:

I/O-bound → asyncio or thread pools.

CPU-bound → multiprocessing/Ray/joblib or offload to vectorized libs.

Keep chunks large enough (≥50k–1M rows) to amortize overhead.

GC and allocations:

Limit short-lived object churn; batch work.

For very large loops, occasionally gc.collect() (measure impact).

OS-level: Use mmap for large read-only files; pin process to large pages if applicable.

Quick example (streaming transform):

from csv import reader
from itertools import islice

def rows(path, chunk=1_000_000):
    with open(path, 'r', newline='') as f:
        r = reader(f)
        while True:
            block = list(islice(r, chunk))
            if not block: break
            yield block

def process_file(path):
    # process 1M rows at a time to keep memory flat
    for block in rows(path):
        # vectorize inside each block if possible
        # e.g., convert to numpy and operate
        pass

2) Structuring a secure, scalable Django/Flask app
Project structure (modular, 12-factor)
app/
  __init__.py
  api/              # blueprints/apps per domain (users, payments, etc.)
    users/
      __init__.py
      routes.py
      schemas.py    # Pydantic/Marshmallow/DRF serializers
      services.py   # business logic
      repo.py       # data access
      models.py
  core/             # cross-cutting: config, logging, security, db
    config.py
    db.py
    security.py
    logging.py
  tasks/            # Celery/async jobs
tests/
migrations/


Django: use apps per domain, settings/ package (base/dev/prod), urls.py routes per app, DRF for APIs.

Flask: use Blueprints per domain, an app factory, and dependency injection for services.

Authentication

Django: built-in auth + Django REST Framework (DRF) with JWT (e.g., djangorestframework-simplejwt). Use SessionAuth only for server-rendered admin.

Flask: Flask-JWT-Extended for JWT or flask-login (server-rendered). Rotate secrets, short token TTL, refresh tokens, blacklist support.

Authorization

Role/permission checks at service boundaries.

In Django, use django-guardian for object-level perms if needed; in Flask, simple policy decorators or Oso/Casbin.

Request validation

Django/DRF: serializers handle validation/typing.

Flask: Pydantic or Marshmallow with webargs; validate both query and body.

Enforce idempotency keys on write endpoints that can be retried (payments).

Security & ops

Settings via environment; separate secrets (vault).

HTTPS everywhere, HSTS, CSRF (if sessions), CORS allowlist.

Central logging (JSON), request IDs, structured metrics, health checks.

3) Async fan-out to multiple APIs (Python)

Tools: asyncio, aiohttp (client), async-timeout, optional retry (tenacity), uvloop for faster event loop (Linux).

import asyncio, aiohttp
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
from aiohttp import ClientTimeout

@asynccontextmanager
async def session():
    timeout = ClientTimeout(total=10)  # global timeout
    conn = aiohttp.TCPConnector(limit=100)  # connection pool
    async with aiohttp.ClientSession(timeout=timeout, connector=conn) as s:
        yield s

async def fetch(s, url, **kwargs):
    for attempt in range(3):
        try:
            async with s.get(url, **kwargs) as r:
                r.raise_for_status()
                return await r.json()
        except Exception:
            if attempt == 2: raise
            await asyncio.sleep(0.2 * (2 ** attempt))

async def aggregate(urls):
    async with session() as s:
        sem = asyncio.Semaphore(20)  # backpressure
        async def wrapped(u):
            async with sem:
                return await fetch(s, u)
        return await asyncio.gather(*(wrapped(u) for u in urls), return_exceptions=False)

# asyncio.run(aggregate([...]))


Notes:

Use semaphores to cap concurrency.

Set timeouts and retries per call.

Parse results defensively; prefer pydantic models for schemas.

4) Payment REST API design (verbs, endpoints)

Resources: transactions, refunds, customers (optional).

POST /transactions – create a charge.

Body: amount, currency, source, idempotency-key (header).

Returns 201 + transaction.

GET /transactions?customer_id=&status=&from=&to=&limit=&cursor= – list (paginated).

GET /transactions/{txn_id} – fetch one.

POST /transactions/{txn_id}/capture – capture an auth (action endpoint).

POST /refunds – create refund for a txn (or POST /transactions/{id}/refunds).

GET /refunds/{refund_id} – fetch refund.

GET /refunds?transaction_id= – list.

Idempotency: all POSTs accept Idempotency-Key.

Status codes: 201 (created), 200 (OK), 202 (async accepted), 400/401/403/404, 409 (conflict), 422 (validation), 429 (rate limit).

Webhooks: payment.succeeded, refund.created, signed & replay-protected.

Security: JWT/OAuth2; mTLS for provider callbacks; never expose full PAN (PCI DSS).

5) Asynchronous task queues (slow background jobs)

Choose based on workload:

Celery + Redis/RabbitMQ: mature, retries, ETA/cron, chords. Great for CPU/I/O mix if tasks aren’t trivial.

RQ/Dramatiq/Huey: simpler queues on Redis.

Asyncio workers: if you already run an async app and tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., aio-pika + RabbitMQ, or arq).

AWS SQS + Lambda: serverless queue processing.

Celery example:

# tasks/celery_app.py
from celery import Celery
celery = Celery(__name__, broker="redis://:pwd@redis:6379/0", backend="redis://redis:6379/1")
celery.conf.task_acks_late = True
celery.conf.worker_prefetch_multiplier = 1  # fair dispatch

@celery.task(bind=True, autoretry_for=(Exception,), retry_backoff=True, max_retries=5)
def generate_report(self, user_id):
    # heavy work...
    return {"url": f"/reports/{user_id}.pdf"}


Producer (web request handler):

task = generate_report.delay(user_id)
return {"task_id": task.id}, 202


Monitoring: Flower/Prometheus metrics, dead letter queues, idempotent tasks.

6) Recursive Binary Search (on a sorted array)
def binary_search(arr, target, lo=0, hi=None):
    if hi is None:
        hi = len(arr) - 1
    if lo > hi:
        return -1  # not found
    mid = (lo + hi) // 2
    if arr[mid] == target:
        return mid
    elif arr[mid] > target:
        return binary_search(arr, target, lo, mid - 1)
    else:
        return binary_search(arr, target, mid + 1, hi)

# Demo
arr = [0,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,80]
x = 30
idx = binary_search(arr, x)
if idx == -1:
    print(f"{x} not found in array.")
else:
    print(f"{x} found at index {idx}.")

7) Designing for high-volume concurrent I/O (async)

Principles: event loop, cooperative coroutines, connection pooling, timeouts, backpressure, cancellation, observability.

Stack: asyncio + aiohttp or httpx[async], uvloop (Linux), aio-pg/asyncpg for Postgres, aioredis, aiokafka.

Server example (aiohttp):

import asyncio
from aiohttp import web, ClientSession, ClientTimeout

async def handle(request):
    query = request.query.get("q", "")
    async with ClientSession(timeout=ClientTimeout(total=5)) as s:
        async with s.get(f"https://example.com/search?q={query}") as r:
            data = await r.json()
    return web.json_response({"data": data})

app = web.Application()
app.add_routes([web.get("/search", handle)])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    web.run_app(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8080)


Tuning:

uvloop (import uvloop; uvloop.install()),

Semaphore around client calls,

Circuit breakers (pybreaker),

Bulkheads per dependency,

Timeouts & retries with jitter,

Structured logging & tracing (OpenTelemetry).

8) Customizing Django Admin

ModelAdmin options: list_display, list_filter, search_fields, ordering, readonly_fields, date_hierarchy, list_select_related.

Forms & validation: custom ModelForm, override clean().

Inlines: TabularInline / StackedInline for related models.

Actions: bulk operations via actions = [export_csv].

Queryset control: override get_queryset, per-user filtering with has_module_permission, get_readonly_fields.

Layout: fieldsets, filter_horizontal, raw_id_fields.

Branding: subclass AdminSite, override templates (admin/base_site.html).

Performance: list_select_related, autocomplete_fields.

9) i18n & l10n in Django

Settings:

LANGUAGE_CODE = 'en'
USE_I18N = True
USE_L10N = True
USE_TZ = True
LANGUAGES = [('en','English'),('fil','Filipino'),('es','Spanish')]
LOCALE_PATHS = [BASE_DIR / 'locale']
MIDDLEWARE = ['django.middleware.locale.LocaleMiddleware', ...]


Mark strings: from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _; _("Checkout")

Templates: {% load i18n %}{% trans "Hello" %}

Messages workflow:

django-admin makemessages -l fil -l es
django-admin compilemessages


Per-request language: /i18n/setlang/ view or Accept-Language header.

Dates & numbers: {{ value|localize }}, django.utils.formats. For currency, prefer Babel:

from babel.numbers import format_currency
format_currency(1234.5, 'PHP', locale='fil_PH')  # '₱1,234.50'


URLs: use i18n_patterns for localized paths if needed.

10) E-commerce microservices architecture

Services (bounded contexts):

Auth (users, tokens)

Catalog (products, pricing, inventory read model)

Cart (ephemeral, per user)

Orders (checkout, order states)

Payments (charge providers, webhooks)

Inventory (stock reservations, adjustments)

Fulfillment (shipping, tracking)

Communication:

Synchronous: REST/gRPC for read/command request/response.

Asynchronous: Kafka (or SNS/SQS) for domain events (e.g., order.created, payment.succeeded), Saga pattern for multi-step workflows.

Data: each service owns its DB (polyglot: Postgres for orders, DynamoDB for cart, Elasticsearch/OpenSearch for search).

API Gateway: single entry (rate-limit, auth, request validation, aggregation). Canary releases.

Observability: central logging, tracing (OpenTelemetry), metrics (Prometheus), dashboards, SLOs, circuit breakers.

Resilience: idempotency, retries with backoff, DLQs, outbox pattern for reliable event publishing.

11) Script: fetch paginated REST API and upload to S3 as JSON
import os, json, time, requests, boto3

API_URL = "https://api.example.com/items"
S3_BUCKET = "my-bucket"
S3_KEY = "exports/items.json"
HEADERS = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {os.environ['API_TOKEN']}"}

def fetch_all():
    items, page = [], 1
    while True:
        r = requests.get(API_URL, params={"page": page, "limit": 200}, headers=HEADERS, timeout=15)
        r.raise_for_status()
        data = r.json()
        items.extend(data["results"])
        if not data.get("next"): break
        page += 1
        time.sleep(0.2)  # be nice
    return items

def upload_json_s3(obj, bucket, key):
    s3 = boto3.client("s3")
    body = json.dumps(obj, separators=(",", ":"), ensure_ascii=False).encode("utf-8")
    s3.put_object(Bucket=bucket, Key=key, Body=body, ContentType="application/json")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    all_items = fetch_all()
    upload_json_s3(all_items, S3_BUCKET, S3_KEY)
    print(f"Uploaded {len(all_items)} records to s3://{S3_BUCKET}/{S3_KEY}")


Adjust pagination to your API style: ?cursor=..., Link headers, etc.

Use instance profile/role or env vars for AWS creds; consider multipart upload for very large payloads.

12) Standardizing REST API development across teams

Design-first with OpenAPI 3; keep specs in repo, reviewed via PR.

API style guide: resource naming, verbs, pagination, filtering, sparse fields, idempotency, error format (RFC 7807), date/time (ISO-8601 UTC), headers, versioning (/v1 or header).

Security standards: OAuth2/JWT, scopes, rate limits, mTLS where needed, secrets management.

Tooling:

Lint OpenAPI (speccy/oaslint), generate server/client stubs.

Contract tests (Pact), schema validation middleware.

Mock servers for dev (Prism).

Observability: request IDs, structured logs, tracing, standard metrics.

Deprecation policy: sunset headers, timelines, changelogs.

Docs portal: Redoc/Swagger UI; examples, curl, SDKs.

13) Hardening an API after a data-exposure report

Triage & scope: what fields leaked, which endpoints, time window, actors.

Immediate controls: feature flag the endpoint, tighten allowlists, raise authz checks, rotate keys/secrets.

Fixes:

Enforce authorization at object level; implement row-level filtering.

Output filtering (never rely on hiding in front-end): serializers return only permitted fields; introduce projections/fields param.

Input validation & schema: strict types; reject unknown fields.

Rate limits/quota; WAF rules for scraping patterns.

TLS everywhere; set security headers; correct CORS.

Audit logging: who accessed what PII; add anomaly detection alerts.

Sensitive data handling: encryption at rest, tokenization where needed, data retention limits.

Tests: add security unit/integration tests; fuzzers; DAST/SAST in CI.

Comms: responsible disclosure process, customer notice if required, post-mortem + preventive backlog.

14) Minimal in-memory users REST API (Flask)
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify, abort

app = Flask(__name__)
USERS = {}  # in-memory store

@app.errorhandler(400)
def bad_request(e): return jsonify(error="bad_request", detail=str(e)), 400
@app.errorhandler(404)
def not_found(e): return jsonify(error="not_found"), 404

@app.post("/users")
def add_user():
    data = request.get_json(force=True, silent=False)
    if not data or "id" not in data or "name" not in data:
        abort(400, "id and name required")
    uid = str(data["id"])
    if uid in USERS:
        abort(400, "user already exists")
    USERS[uid] = {"id": uid, "name": data["name"], "email": data.get("email")}
    return jsonify(USERS[uid]), 201

@app.get("/users/<uid>")
def get_user(uid):
    u = USERS.get(uid)
    if not u: abort(404)
    return jsonify(u)

@app.get("/users")
def list_users():
    return jsonify(list(USERS.values()))

@app.delete("/users/<uid>")
def delete_user(uid):
    if uid not in USERS: abort(404)
    del USERS[uid]
    return "", 204

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()

15) Quick technical discussion: APIs & ETL

APIs: contracts for synchronous interaction; prefer idempotent operations, timeouts, retries, and pagination.

ETL/ELT: bulk/batch pipelines; CDC from OLTP to analytics; schema evolution via schema registry (Avro/Protobuf).

Bridging both: event-driven outbox → Kafka → stream processors (Flink/Spark) → lake/warehouse (Iceberg/Delta) with idempotent sinks, data quality checks (Great Expectations), and backfills.

Consistency: choose at-least-once with idempotency or exactly-once semantics in stream processors where needed.

16) Hard conversations with management (timelines, code issues)

Lead with data: show burn-down, blockers, defect rates, perf numbers.

SBI/NVC: Situation–Behavior–Impact framing; separate code from coder.

Offer options: (a) reduce scope, (b) extend time, (c) add staff (trade-offs explicit).

Risk register: what happens if we don’t act.

Next steps: propose a plan (feature flags, incremental rollout, stabilization sprint).

Follow-ups: written summary, owners, dates.

17) Urgent server issues

Declare incident (SEV, commander, comms channel).

Triage: health checks, error rates, saturation; rollback recent changes.

Stabilize: scale out, toggle features, rate limits, circuit breakers.

Root cause after restore: logs + traces + diffs.

Post-mortem: blameless; action items, owners, deadlines.

Prevent: runbooks, SLOs, canaries, chaos drills.

Monolith → Microservices migration (safe path):

Strangler-Fig pattern: route specific endpoints to new services via gateway; keep monolith as system of record initially.

Domain carve-out: pick low-risk bounded contexts (e.g., auth, catalog read).

Data: replicate via CDC to new service DBs; use anti-corruption layer; outbox for events.

Observability first; CI/CD per service; finish by retiring monolith modules.

18) End-to-end AWS design (React + Python + real-time + CI/CD)

Frontend caching (React without Redux):

Use React Query (or MobX if preferred).

Stale-While-Revalidate: staleTime for hot lists; background refetch.

Query keys: normalized keys per resource.

Cache persistence: session/localStorage for short-term offline.

Request de-dup: React Query does this automatically for identical keys.

Serve SPA from S3 + CloudFront with long-TTL immutable assets, short-TTL HTML.

Add edge caching for specific API GETs via CloudFront + API Gateway with cache key on headers/query (careful with auth).

Backend:

Python service (FastAPI/Flask) on ECS Fargate or Lambda behind API Gateway.

Route 53 → CloudFront (optional) → API Gateway (custom domain) → Lambda/ECS.

Auth: Cognito User Pools (OIDC/JWT). API Gateway authorizer validates tokens; service enforces scopes/claims.

Authorization: fine-grained via claims (e.g., cognito:groups), resource policies; S3/IAM for server-to-server.

Real-time processing:

Kinesis Data Streams ingest events.

Lambda consumers (or Kinesis Data Analytics if you need SQL windows).

Store processed data in DynamoDB (low-latency) and archive to S3 (lake).

Use Firehose to deliver batches to S3 with compression/partitioning.

Idempotency with event sequenceNumber and DynamoDB conditional writes.

CI/CD with infra as code:

CodeCommit (or GitHub) → CodeBuild (tests, lint, unit/e2e) → CodePipeline.

CloudFormation (or CDK) stacks for VPC, ECS/Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, Kinesis, S3, CloudFront, Route53.

Blue/Green or Canary deployments (CodeDeploy for Lambda/ECS).

Env separation: dev/stage/prod accounts; parameterize via SSM Parameter Store/Secrets Manager.

Quality gates: security scans (Bandit, pip-audit), SAST, OpenAPI validation, contract tests.

Observability: CloudWatch logs/metrics, X-Ray tracing, alarms (SNS/PagerDuty).

Sample React Query snippet (frontend caching):

// useProducts.ts
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
export function useProducts() {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ['products'],
    queryFn: () => fetch('/api/v1/products').then(r => r.json()),
    staleTime: 60_000, // 1 min SWR
    refetchOnWindowFocus: false
  })
}


API Gateway + Cognito (high level):

Configure a Cognito Authorizer on API methods; require Authorization: Bearer <JWT>.

In Lambda/FastAPI, verify scopes/claims for resource access.
