- if you have a multiple thread running we wanted to have structured way of getting in and out of the data 

 okay so imagine if i have list of 5 numbers 
 and i have a 3 threads running. now each of the threads will process its number let say it will find its hex number 

 let say t1 process 0, t2 process 1, t3 process 2 
 if t1 is finish it should process 3
 
 so let say we use a counter for this in which we add 1 if we finish it so that we know the the next index that we would want 

 but since thread is unpredictable because of the scheduler imagine t1,t2,t3 manage to finish at the same time now 
 we are skipping index
