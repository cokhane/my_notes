Query instances via useQuery or useInfinite query by default consider cached data as stale
- you can configure your stale time to make sure data is read from cache
- setting staletime is the recommender way to avoid excessive refetches


#Query Basics
- a query is a declarative dependency on an asnyc source of data that is tied to a unique key.
- can be used with any promise base method
- if your method modifies data on server, we recommend using Mutations instead.

- to subscribe to a query in your component or custom hooks, call the useQuery hook with at least:
	- unique key for the query
	- a function that returns promise that
		- resolves data,
		- throw error
